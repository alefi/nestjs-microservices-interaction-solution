# Protobuf gRPC component

To generate Typescript typings, place protobuf files in `./proto` folder and run:

```console
npm run protobuf:build-types
```

> 📝 _Do not edit autogenerated files._

To rebuild after proto buffer files were changed, run the same command.
Don't forget to explicitly append demanded proto file(s) to a particular application's configuration. [Example](../../apps/user/src/config/user-service-grpc-server.constants.ts).
